## Overview

This repository contains a collection of my data science-related projects. Below are brief descriptions of each key projects featured in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. Binomial Sentiment Classification Model

This project focuses on classifying user comments left for the EGOV mobile app into positive or negative sentiments. A Naive Bayes classifier is utilized for this task due to its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification problems. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of comments and then evaluated for its accuracy in predicting the sentiment of unseen data.

### 2. Mixture Gamma Distribution

As part of a research project, this code explores the performance of the Chi-Square goodness of fit test for a mixture of gamma distributions with varying parameters and proportions. The aim is to evaluate how well the Chi-Square test can detect deviations from the expected distribution when dealing with complex mixtures.
